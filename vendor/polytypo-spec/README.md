# Vendored spec subset

This directory is a manually-synced copy of the subset of `polytypo/polytypo`'s canonical `spec/`
that this repository's build and test suite read: `locales/`, `fixtures/`, `rules/order.json`,
`rules/dashes.md`, `schema/`, `VERSION`, `UNICODE`. It is **not** the canonical spec — the rest of
the normative prose (`spec/rules/*.md` beyond `dashes.md`) and `validate-spec.mjs` live only in
`polytypo/polytypo`. `schema/*.json` is vendored so this repository's own tests can validate the
vendored locale/fixture files structurally (via Python's `jsonschema` package) without
re-implementing `validate-spec.mjs`'s rules by hand.

Editing a file here does not change the spec; it only drifts this copy from canonical. When
canonical's `spec/` changes, re-copy the affected files here.

CI checks that it was done. `scripts/check-vendored-spec.sh` compares every file in this
directory against canonical `polytypo/polytypo` at tag `spec-v` + this directory's own
`VERSION`, and fails on any difference. Three details: the files this repository authors
itself are listed in `.not-canonical` and skipped; `locales/*.json` are compared with the
`sources` array dropped from both sides, which is the one field a vendored copy may
legitimately differ in; and a file here with no canonical counterpart is a failure, so a
canonical rename cannot pass unnoticed. Completeness is deliberately not checked — each
runtime vendors its own subset, and the subsets differ.

Before that check existed, this half of the tree went stale unnoticed in four of the five
ports at once: the data half is proved by the test suite, and nothing at all read the prose.
See `polytypo/polytypo` issue #56. How this vendoring will work
long-term (submodule, per-ecosystem spec package, or something else) is an open decision tracked
in `polytypo/polytypo`'s `docs/ROADMAP.md`; this is the interim, manually-synced form — the same
status `polytypo-js`'s own vendored `spec/` copy has.

## `locales/*.json` here keep their `sources`, and the shipped copy does not

These files are a build input, not a shipped artifact, so the citations cost nothing here and are
worth having next to the data they justify. The generated/installed copy drops them: no rule reads
the citations, and they are 94% of the locale payload by raw bytes (193 KB of 206 KB, against 13 KB
of everything the engine actually consults). See the generator for exactly where that happens.
